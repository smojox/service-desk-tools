Example calculation of the Verification code: 

Notice of Rejection Date = 19/07/2015. 

Subtract the first two digits of the Notice of Rejection Date from 100 

100 – 19 = 81 

 

Convert the month to a singular alpha character (Jan = A, Feb = B, etc) 

07 = G 

 

Take the last digit from the year 

5 

 

Take the Notice Type number as displayed in the table below: 

 

Notice Type Number 

Contravention Type(s) 

1 

Parking, Moving Traffic, Littering from Vehicle, Household Waste, Commercial/Industrial Waste, London Lorry Control Scheme, Road User Charging 

2 

Being in a bus lane 

8 

Clamp Vehicle 

9 

Remove Vehicle 

 

 For example, if the Notice Type is a Parking PCN. 

1 

 

Calculate a check digit to go on the end of this code, making it a 6 character code. 

Convert the alpha character to a number 

A,B,C … J  become 1, 2, 3 … 0,  

K, L … T  become 1, 2 … 0, 

U … Z  become 1 … 6 

 

 G = 7 

 

For calculation of check digit you now have the number 81751 

 

Calculate (a*5) + (b*4) + (c*3) + (d*2) + (e*1) where ‘a’ to ‘e’ are the five numbers derived above. 

(8*5) = 40 

(1*4) =  4 

(7*3) = 21 

(5*2) = 10 

(1*1) =  1 

 

Total = 76 

 

Divide the result by 11  

 

76 / 11 = 6 (ignoring remaining fraction – in this instance full result is 6.909) 

 

Calculate the remainder as a whole number 

6 * 11 = 66 

76 – 66 = 10 

 

The remainder is the check digit.  (If the remainder is 10 then the check digit is A) 

 

You now have the 6 digit PIN 81G51A 

You now have the six digit verification code 81G51A
